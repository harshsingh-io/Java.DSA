### Notes on BFS (Breadth-First Search) Traversal

**Introduction**  
- BFS is a critical traversal technique for solving graph problems.  
- It explores nodes level by level (breadth-wise), ensuring all nodes at a given distance from the starting node are visited before moving to the next level.  

---

**BFS Concept**  
- **Key Terms**:  
  - *Breadth*: Refers to exploring all nodes at the same level (distance) before moving deeper.  
  - *Level-wise Traversal*: Nodes are visited in layers (level 0 → level 1 → level 2 → ...).  
- **Graph Types**: Works with both 1-based and 0-based indexed graphs.  

---

**Traversal Steps**  
1. **Initial Configuration**:  
   - Use a **queue** (FIFO) to manage nodes.  
   - Maintain a **visited array** to track processed nodes.  
   - Start with the initial node in the queue and mark it as visited.  

2. **Processing Nodes**:  
   - Dequeue a node.  
   - Print or process the node.  
   - Enqueue **unvisited neighbors** and mark them as visited.

**Example Walkthrough**  
**Graph Structure**:  
- Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (1-based indexing).  
- Adjacency List:  
  - Node 1 → [2, 6]  
  - Node 2 → [1, 3, 4]  
  - Node 6 → [1, 7, 9] (etc.)  

**Starting Node 1**:  
- **Level 0**: 1.  
- **Level 1**: 2, 6 (added from 1’s neighbors).  
- **Level 2**: 3, 4, 7, 9 (neighbors of 2 and 6).  
- **Level 3**: 5, 8, etc.

**Code Examples** 

**Java Code**:  
```java
public List<Integer> bfsOfGraph(int V, List<List<Integer>> adj) {
    List<Integer> bfs = new ArrayList<>();
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
    Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
    
    visited[0] = true; // Assuming 0-based index
    q.add(0);
    
    while (!q.isEmpty()) {
        int node = q.poll();
        bfs.add(node);
        
        for (int neighbor : adj.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.add(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    return bfs;
}
```

**Key Components**:  
- **Queue**: Manages traversal order (FIFO).  
- **Visited Array**: Prevents revisiting nodes.  
- **Adjacency List**: Stores graph connections.  
**C++ Code**:  
```cpp
vector<int> bfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
    vector<int> bfs;
    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    queue<int> q;
    
    visited[0] = true; // Assuming 0-based index
    q.push(0);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        bfs.push_back(node);
        
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    return bfs;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N is nodes and M is edges.  
  - Each node and edge are processed once.  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)  
  - Queue and visited array storage.

**When to Use?**

- Do we need to explore all complete paths? **(no)**
- Do we need to backtrack to explore different branches? (**no)**
- Do we need to do a level order traversal? **(yes)**

**CHOOSE BFS**

**Summary**  
BFS systematically explores nodes level by level using a queue, ensuring efficient traversal with linear time and space complexity. Understanding BFS is foundational for solving numerous graph-related problems.

   - `queue = [2, 7]`.  
   - `bfs_order = [1]`.

The BFS traversal explores nodes level-by-level, starting from node 1 and visiting all nodes at each depth before moving deeper.
