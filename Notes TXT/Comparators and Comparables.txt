difference between comparator and compatible when to use comparator went to is compatible so let's get started now what we'll do here is first of all let's create a list of values normally when you want to use comparator compatible this is where you will be using it so let's create a list of values and I will say I want to create a list of laptops now can we do that say yes we can do that we can get a list of laptop provided you have a laptop class and you can see we do have it here now we don't have any variables here let me create some variables I would say private int the first one would be laptop let's say let's let's name it as laptop brand and then the next one would be I want to create a amount of RAM it has and then I want to create I want to make one more variable which is price again we can have some more variables but then this is enough so we got to brand the god ram and record price now here i want to assign a getters and setters for this i will say right like generates organisators and said all the variables click on ok now once we go again who does let me also use or to show me those I would say sews to string and regard all these things now once we got a laptop here that's cool right let's go back to run now if I say least of laptops and if I say labs here equal to your new added least and if I say okay we got a least right and let me input the package for at least and we got it here okay so we got a list of laptops you know whatever would be I want a constructor to assign the values I would say right click and say Souls I want a constructor with field so I will say select all click on OK let me add some laptops I would say labs dot add I want to add the first laptop by saying new laptop and here I want to pass those values so the first thing I have to pass is the laptop brand name so I would say the brand is Dell and I want to price specify the RAM amount of RAM it has well it's a 16gb and the price is let's say $800 okay so we got the first laptop here let's go for one more I will say lab start add it's a new laptop and this laptop let's say this is Apple and I want to say this has let's say a GB RAM but the cost is let's say $200 because as you know Apple machines are costly and I say laps dot add one more will say new laptop and we got let's say this is ASA and ASA also has let's say - L GB RAM the cost of ASA is let's say $700 okay so we got these three laptops here right and now what am I do is I want to sort them now basically when you anyway you have a list of integers when you have lists of string we can very easily sort those values by saying we we have a class for less connections connections dot sort in which you just have to pass a list it will work so if you pass laps I mean if you especially if you have a list of integers then it will perfectly work but in this case you can see it is not working so list of integers will work list of string will work but least of laptops is not working what this sort will do is his sort will sort the values based on some parameter right example let's say if you pass five values and if you say hey sort it now your Java framework is smart enough or do collation framework is smart enough to know that when you say sort numbers you have to sort them in ascending or ascending order but in this case how do you sort this laptop ascending order on which parameter you want to sort maybe you want to sort based on the brand name maybe you want to sort based on the RAM maybe you want to sort based on the price we have not specified the parameter here right and that's why this will not work so I will just click on sort so you can see if you are aware our genrich's so what it's saying is it will take only those things which are comparable so this sort method will accept only those things which are compatible now what it is so if you want to sort your laptop you need to implement a interface called as compatible otherwise it will not work so the best thing you have to do is you have to implement our interface called is compatible and that's where now you can sort them can see that it is gone so when you say you want to pass at least you have to make sure that whatever least you have all the values in them are compatible and the way you do that is by implementing compatible now you can specify a logic so you can have your own logic here by specifying what parameter you have to compare this and to implement that we have to implement or method which is compared to so compatible interface has this mythical as compared to and let's say this takes laptop object I would say laptop - so this is a laptop - up now what happens is this will sort right so this sort method will sort all the all the laptops but the concern here is which sorting technique is implement doesn't matter and that's the power of Java right the object unit programming you're not concerned about the implementation what you're concerned about is we are getting the output now when you say is sought internally it will try to swap values so if you have seen all the sorting techniques in algorithms you must have seen that right it's all about going to swap and when not to swear so here in the compact - we just have to specify when to swap and when not to swap so basically you'll be comparing two objects and by comparing those two objects you will specify when to swap and not to swap but here the problem is you are passing only one object right how can you pass two objects the thing is come back to is a method of laptop class so for sure to call compare to method you need one object so that means by default you have an object which is calling compared to and you also have one more object which is getting passed so in total there are two objects which are acting here the first object which is calling this method the second object which you are passing it here now how do we access an object which you are calling so let's say if you are using an object lap one and by using lap one object you're calling compared to how do we access that object here so basically we use our this keyword to access that right so we can refer that to the above this keyword and then the second objects laptop now how do you compare these two objects so compared to says you just returned me some values it may be a positive value or a negative value or zero now when to return what so if you think the first object is thick is greater than the second object you return positive number if the first object is less than the second object you return a negative number and if the first object and the second object are same then you return zero so what I mean by that is if you say a valid in comment I will say this if this first object is greater than the second object now based on whatever parameter you want so in that case you will return you will return a positive value so I will say plus if the first object is less than the second object you return a negative value and if the first object is equal to the second object you return zero now how do we implement this see it's very simple you simply say if if this okay now we own which parameter you want to sort so when I say I want to sort laptops I want to sort them based on the RAM so the first laptop will have the least RAM and the last laptop will have the highest RAM in that case you will say this dot Ram or maybe get Ram is greater than lab two dot get Ram in this case you will return a positive value this positon bur can be anything we can say 356 you can use any positive value but why do you specify such a big number okay 256 is just a random number you can also specify one or you can specify 250 you can specify 500 doesn't matter any positive number so I will say +1 and else you will say return -1 you can also verify if this dot get ram is equal to equal to lab 2 dot get ram you can return 0 if there if they are equal but then that's fine this should work so we are comparing it right now let's correct it on now let's verify if they are sorting it but how do we know that they are sorted - let me just print the entire collection here I will use our enhance for dr. Parenti collection so I would say laptop L : labs and then I will print one by one object I will print L let's verify if it is working let's run this code and you can see that we got the output and all the laptops are sorted based on the RAM we got 8 12 and 16 it's that simple so what you do is if you want to sort a collection of values or list of values what you do is you implement a comparable interface so every class need to have a compatible if you want to sort them so this is perfect okay that's about compatible ok I hope you enjoyed you understood what is compatible but now the next point is what is competitor and why do we need competitive and you have compatible now we will be using comparator in two's to situation the first situation is what if you got a class and this class is not implementing any interface imagine you know the thing which we have done here let's say if you don't have this now what you will do in this scenario you cannot sort the values right then you will say ok we have to make sure that you have those interfaces or you you implement that interface on you you implement that method the point is what you get this class from somewhere else so maybe you are using some third-party library and that library has this class now of course you cannot change the source code right you have a class file now what you will do in that case what you do is you so if you can say sort you can give a comma and you can specify the logic here see the sort method is only concerned about the logic right so can you pass a logic here and the answer is yes if you can see this sort method it takes two parameters also it takes a least first time it takes a comparator object so basically it takes two parameters so you can pass one list or you can pass two parameters that's the first scenario well be using comparator you can specify your logic with type of comparator the second scenario is even if you have this logic here so even if I say you have implements compatible you have this method what if I want to sort them based on some other parameter because by default it will be getting sorted by on based on Graham I want maybe I want to sort based on price then what you will do is you will pass compared again so let me pass a laptop object and let's give a comma and here we have to pass an object of comparator and the way you do that is by saying compare comparator so you will use compiler interface and I will say this comparator is working with laptop I would say comparator kumkum equal to new comparator now basically comparator is an interface so of course we cannot directly get object of that right so we have to define the class here it's this is basically anonymous in the class if you're not if you're if you don't know what is anonymous in the class you can watch one of my video on anonymous inner class I do have a video on that so this is where this is how you instantiate the interface by creating a class enormous in a class here now which method we have to define so if I go back on the in the comparator you can see the method name or medium the method it has is compare method name is compare so I will say public in compared and this compare takes two parameters if you can see here it takes two parameters so I would say it is laptop l1 comma laptop l2 so basically we got two laptops here now in the case of compatible we were comparing with this right the current object and lapto but in this case we have those two objects itself amita so what you will do you you will just say Museum logics if the first object is greater than so I will say if L 1 dot get rise is greater than L 2 dot get price you will return a positive value I will return 1 else return 0 so now we we are having our own logic just pass a comparator object here your job is done so now it will sort the values but based on the prize so if you're in this code you can see oh it's not working something went wrong oh sorry I just made a mistake here it should be minus 1 a negative value right and let's run this code now and you see that we got 700 800 and 1,200 it's that simple so when you will use a comparator when you have a class which is not implementing an interface example if I even if I remove this now we don't need compatible if you're using comparator so let's go back to runner and you can see it is it will get it will get sorted because we are passing a logic so when we use comparator to situation first when your class is not implementing compatible and second situation is when you want to change the logic or when you want to change the way it sorts the value now you want to thinking when we were sorting the list of integers it was walking because integer class so all the classes in Java you know the integer class if you click on integer integer class you can see that it implements compatible if you talk about string class even string class implements compatible so all the inbuilt classes which we use where we store values they all implements compatible but by default if you sort those values they will have their own logic what if you want to have your logic then in that case you will use comparator so I hope you understood some difference between compatible and comparator
